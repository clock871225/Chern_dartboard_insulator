- Here are the source codes of the paper "*Chern dartboard insulator: sub-Brillouin zone topology and skyrmion multipoles*".
- **Model** folder contains the tight-binding models of all the CDIs. It also includes the codes for plotting Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. The codes for plotting Fig. 4 are inside the type1_CDI_1.py file.
- **Function** folder contains the functions for calculating physical properties of the models.
- **Data** folder contains the data for plotting figures in the paper.
- To run the codes, please install the package "pythtb" as all the tight-binding models are constructed through this package. For more information, see http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/pythtb/.
